<p>Martini Shot movie app....the backend!</p><br>
<p>This is the back end portion of my movie app called "Martini Shot".</p><br>
<p>To see the front end of the code you can find it in my Github repository under the name "movie api client".<br>
It's pretty rad.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>To build the server-side of my app, the following languages and methods were used:<br>
Javascript<br>
JWT<br>
Passport<br>
Post SQL<br>
Mongoose<br>
MongoDB<br>
Nodejs<br>
Express<br>
