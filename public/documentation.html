        In Dale's Movie App, "Martini Shot", named after the day's final shot on a film set, movie enthusiasts will be able to search through a database of movies loaded from an external database using a REST API I built myself. Users will be able to search for their favourite titles, actors, genre, directors and more. The App will be built from the ground up and will utilize the server, business logic layer and data layer. The app and API will be crafted using Javascript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB. Martini Shot will be hosted online for movie lovers to search the database anytime they would like to read about their favourite actors, favourite directors, anything movie related. Once a user has registered, they will be able to create their own profile to save any "favourites" or "must watch" movies to a list they can edit as they please. Movies are a huge part of our culture and can make us feel happy, contemplative, melancholy, afraid or they can take us to a galaxy far far away. This app is for anyone who enjoys knowing more about what's on the screen.
